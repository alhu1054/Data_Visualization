    "\n",
    "- Where are the solutions coming from? What is their distribution per country & per region?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What type of energy source is more prevalent, what is less? Are there differences per region, and why?\n",

    "- What overall challenges are the solutions addressing or contributing to overcome?\n",
    "\n",

    "The tasks pusued will be:\n",
    "1. Identifying the geographic areas the solutions are comming from and the types of energies used geographically. \n",
    " - The goal of the task is learning from which areas are more solutions comming and from which less, maybe to see where would it be best to invest in such solutions and where to help develop new solutions. \n",
    " - The means or how would be comparing the number of solutions per country and regional area.\n",
    " - The task seek to learn how many solutions exist per region. \n",
    " - It operates on the data gathered by the mappers that says where each solution comes from. \n",
    " - Workflow would be to be able to zoom in by region to see solutions by country. \n",
    " - The task would be executed by a general user. \n",
    " \n",
    "2. Identifying if they are general patterns of the type of energies used geographically for Clean Cooking solutions.  \n",
    " - To see if some energies are more prevalent in different regions and what countries in the region could need more of it. \n",
    " - By looking at the types of energies in a map.\n",
    " - Where are energies more prevalent. \n",
    " - Same data as before plus the data column specifing the kind of energies.\n",
    " - The workflow \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Looking at the ratios of DYI vs IP and Prototype vs Product by region and country. \n",
    " - To see what kind of projects are more prevalent by region and country. \n",
    " - The means would be looking at the ratios of both things by country in a scatter plot.\n",
    " - Worlflow is to see if there is any trend by regions.\n",
    " - The task would be executed by general user. \n",
    " \n",

Propensity score matching, a quasi-experiment econometric method, was applied using the 2018 household survey data of the BIDS that collected information from 600 users of Bondhu Chula and 396 users of traditional cook stoves. It was found that about 90 per cent of the study households depend on fuelwood for their energy need for cooking, whether they use Bondhu Chula or not. Other fuels used by both groups of households included tree leaves, hay or jute cake, dung and wooden powder. Except for cow dung, the energy consumption was much less among households using Bondhu Chula compared to the households using traditional cook stoves. This indicates the efficiency of Bondhu Chula in terms of fuel need. The efficiency of Bondhu Chula in fuel use was also observed by comparing the energy use of households before and after the installation of Bondhu Chula. The pertinent statistics showed that energy use significantly dropped after the installation of Bondhu Chula. This was observed for all types of fuel used by Bondhu Chula users. From these results, one can conclude that the use of Bondhu Chula significantly lowers biomass energy consumption. One can also infer that this reduction of energy use significantly reduces air pollution and deforestation because 91 per cent of the sampled households used fuelwood for the purpose of cooking and the sources of fuelwood were mainly trees. The results of the econometric exercise show that the impact of Bondhu Chula use on household biomass energy is significant. It was found that the use of Bondhu Chula reduces the per capita biomass fuel consumption on average, with a range of 9.75 kg to 12.25 kg per month. In terms of percentage reduction, this is about 30-37 per cent compared to the amount of biomass fuel used by traditional cook stoves. The laboratory test, as conducted in Bangladesh by the BCSIR, claims that Bondhu Chula saves 50 per cent fuel compared to traditional cook stoves. The difference between claimed fuel reduction and empirically obtained reduction is perhaps due to varying cooking habits practised by the surveyed households. Based on the above findings, the average level of savings in biomass fuel consumption due to the use of Bondhu Chula to be about 11 kg per household member per month, which is about 600 kg per household per year. With more than 29 million households, Bangladesh has a great market potential for Bondhu Chula. With 67 per cent of households using more than one stove, this could increase the total number of stoves to more than 50 million. Taking this potential market into account, the potential fuelwood consumption saving is about 30 million tonnes per year, which is about 51 per cent of the country's total fuelwood consumption. When converting this biomass fuel-saving into the potential reduction of carbon dioxide emission, we obtain that the use of Bondhu Chula would potentially reduce 50.49 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission per year nationally.

(brief problem & solution description)\": \"a fully enclosed, indoor farm, controlled, soil-less agriculture in residential area. low-cost agriculture. \\nthe farm is just about 180 square feet but produces 200 heads of lettuce and consists of a series of wall pipes, a coy aquarium and rows of custom-made full spectrum china-made, led grow lights. the single room is air-conditioned and has an air purifier and to the extreme right of the room, on the far end from the entrance, there is a tall blue barrel where the water from the aquarium is purified as well (he has never had to change or replace water since first putting water in may, 2020); the purified water is fed to the plants which are seen at different stages of growth, protruding from the holes in the pvc pipes. the main product of the farm at present is variety of lettuce, which he describes as a douglar a trinidadian term for a mix, because it is a cross between the us buttercrunch and a more popular local variety. for lettuces, the main product of the farm, the cycle from seed to harvest is 35 days and is estimated to have at least 18 crop cycles. ronnie believes he can replicate that cycle for strawberries, compared to conventionally grown california strawberries where the seed-to harvest period lasts 49 to 62-days and where there are just 3 crop cycles per year. \\nthe secret to the farm is the exact mix of fertiliser, which comprises treated fish faeces, sea minerals and recycled water and the carefully calibrated lighting. each plant, he explains, requires special lighting for it to absorb the right amount of minerals and for it to grow a particular way. prior to acquiring custom-made chinese lights, the lettuce was limp, the way they are preferred in china.experimenting with other lights, the lettuce was too firm and tough. ronnie also has mature lettuce plants where he can get his seeds for new germination. through his own research, he specified the kind of lighting he wants for his own lettuce, suitable for the trinidad and tobago customer. in one section of the farm, he is growing strawberries (there are a few young ones on the shrub), dwarf apple trees and kiwis.\\n\\nthe people behind the \\\"farm\\\"\\nronnie yearwood and his wife are trinidadian christian missionaries based in guinea bissau for 28 years. they started growing pigeon peas to make trinidadian pelau, a signature dish from trinidad. in guinea bissau's fertile soils the crop flourished, to the extent that what should have been a pigeon peas shrub quickly became a pigeon peas tree. having access to 10 acres of land in cumuto, trinidad, ronnie decided to use two acres for pimento pepper cultivation, hoping to replicate his guinea bissau experience. but ronnie soon discovered, that the caribbean is not africa. the work was arduous and labour intensive, the temperatures were often too high making irrigation pipes a necessity, soils were plagued with root-eating nematodes, and insects proved too many to beat. yields were small both in terms of the amount given and the size of the produce. to make matters worse, ronnie took loan from the agricultural development bank for the project. while the authorities and agriculture shops recommended pesticides, ronnie, a chemist by training,  preferred to avoid the use of commercial pesticides, apart from the standard combinations of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus (npk) formulae. having seen the ease of cultivation in guinea bissau, and the success of large-scale controlled agriculture in california, usa, ronnie decided to study how to produce crops in a clean, pest- and pesticide-free environment, with low water and energy reliance but on a small scale. today that project has become beyond organic \\u201a\\u00e4\\u00ec a small commercial farm operating out of the annex of ronnie and beverley's trinidad and tobago home in east trinidad. ronnie yearwood and beverley, his wife, still live in guinea bissau but they travel home for a few months from time to time. one such visit, in october, 2019, unexpectedly extended for personal reasons and then on account of the covid-19 pandemic, has become a year-long stay and the start of beyond organic, operational since may 2020.\\n\\nthe entire cost of the annex, inclusive of construction, temperature regulation and irrigation, was tt$60,000. the most notable recurrent costs, according to ronnie, is the cotton-wool cosmetic pads that he uses for germinating the seeds, costing tt$10.00 for 100 pads. ronnie looks back and compares the new farm with the cost of the failed 2 acre project two years ago, where he would have had a loan of tt$200,000, plus extensive manual labour. if he hadn't used inherited family land, it would have been even more expensive.\\n\\nimproving the model\\nthe beyond organic model has the potential to produce clean agriculture at a fraction of the cost of conventional agriculture. but ronnie sees ways to further reduce the cost of his operation. for instance, since he is stuck here in trinidad and tobago, he's plugged into the electric grid. however, he had originally wanted to use solar power. in trinidad and tobago, a net producer of fossil-fuel energy, commercial rates are too low to make solar generation practical. for poorer countries where energy is more expensive, he envisages solar powered fans and cooling systems. i asked him about something like a staple carbohydrate, like the hardy dry-land rice currently branded moruga hill rice, in trinidad and tobago. after all, starving\\npeople don't want lettuce and strawberries. this method can be used to grow anything. you just have to do the research and experiment, he explains. some crops just need more space, he further elucidated, indicating that apples will need to be about 6-7 feet apart.\\n\\nronnie's dream\\nronnie wants to experiment with a wider range of crops, especially those that address the cultural needs of people in west africa. his particular dream is to continue working on the project in west africa, which is where his heart is. he explains that this model is not for use everywhere in africa, or everywhere in west africa. in some parts of west africa there are drought conditions from october to july. if they can capture just a little bit of that water and use it effectively, they can have food all year. one tilapia can spawn more than 10,000 fingerlings, meaning that there is a lot of fertiliser for the crops. he wants missionaries like himself to learn the model and use it to grow what the people want and need. nevertheless, while ronnie eyes his adopted home, guinea bissau, he sees the usefulness of his model for small-island countries like his native trinidad and tobago, where there is a high food import bill. his model, he asserts, can reduce the high food import bill of many small-island developing countries. \\n\\nanother area of focus that concerns ronnie is light-engineered plants. since light affects the plants' uptake of nutrients, ronnie envisages the engineering of crops using diffident intensities of light during\\ntheir growth phase, to adjust the level of particular vitamins and minerals that they contain. for example low-potassium lettuce would be suitable for consumption by dialysis patients. confident that he already knows how to do it, ronnie is currently looking for a laboratory where he can get the biological components of his produce tested.\", \"Please insert a link to the solution\": null, \"DIY\": 0, \"IP\": 0, \"The solution holder is able to

(brief problem & solution description)\": \"genesis of the innovation the innovator lives in a cold region where warm water is required for daily use. his family had a conventional hamam, or water-heater, which used wood as fuel. watching smoke escape from the burning wood made him aware of heat wastage. his innovation came out of his experiments on the hamam to use this heat efficiently. he named the innovation after his son raman deep as ramandeep eco hamam. the phrase eco is used as the device is fuel efficient and produced less smoke. conventional hamams get damaged very soon and a lot of energy gets wasted as well. every year or two, either a new one has to be purchased or the top portion needs to be replaced. to address this problem, he modified the hamam by removing the top portion and using aluminum sheet instead of iron sheet. one day when hamam was being used, he forgot to remove a four litre water container he kept on its top. after half an hour while draining out hot water, he realised that he had got additional four litres of hot water without extra effort or cost. this triggered him to utilize the heat otherwise going waste. in his attempt, he removed the aluminum cover and placed a ten litre container of water directly on the top of hamam. but instead of heating the water, the fire got extinguished as the air flow got blocked. the hamam had to be lit again. a metal ring was kept on the hamam and sides were punched to ensure better air flow. but for refueling, still, the container on the top had to be removed, which was cumbersome. a window was then cut for refueling but that led to the escape of flames to the outside and loss of heat. then instead of the window, a door was used, but then complete combustion was not taking place and a lot of smoke was being generated. he kept on addressing one issue after the other and modifying the hamam till he was satisfied with the output. the raman deep eco hamam (water heater) the modified hamam consists of a conventional hamam and two heat exchangers. water is filled in the tank through the inlet and wood is ignited. similar to the conventional hamam, water is directly heated in the lower most chambers. the heat exchangers channelise heat generated through smoke and flames to further heat the water. valves are present to allow water to pass from one chamber to another. when the water in the lower most chamber attains a temperature close to 100 degrees celsius, it can be drained out separately. on being emptied, the lower chamber can be refilled with water from other chambers. as this water is preheated, it takes less time and fuel to reach 100 degrees celsius. alternatively, once water in the lower chamber reaches 100 degrees celsius, it can be mixed so the overall temperature becomes around 55 degrees celsius. the water from other chambers can also be separately drained out through separate outlets. better fuel utilization reduces the money and/or labour involved in obtaining fuel wood. the hamam has been tested at ctae, udaipurm which has found its thermal efficiency to be 58% against 38.5% of conventional hamam. the co/co2 ratio was found 0.035 in modified hamam and 0.038 in conventional hamam which are within the safe limits. the concept of utilizing heat of smoke by using heat exchangers in the path of smoke or flumes is known in art (us patent 4377200, 4397297, 4628869, 4137965, etc) however, the same is not available for domestic stoves. accordingly, nif filed a patent in the innovator's name (1743/del/2011). he is awaiting the grant of the patent to start commercialization of the hamam. he takes time out from his photo studio to organize flower shows in town, particularly for school children and teachers. his technique of growing begonias on bricks has been tested and proved successful by \\u201a\\u00e4\\u00f2the royal horticulture society', uk, which also published his work in their publication garden in 2000. he is a life time member of the society and was invited for the chelsea flower show held at london during 23-26 may 2000. also he was invited for the london flower show organized during june 20-21, 2000. in 2004, he also received national integration award for environment protection. he has also been interacting with schools, voluntary organizations, and government officials and sharing his work.\", \"Please insert a link to the solution\": null, \"DIY\": 0, \"IP\": 1, \"The solution holder is able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution\": null, \"What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?\": null, \"Prototype\": 0, \"Product\": 0, \"If this solution is a product, is it available in market?\": \"x\", \"If this solution is a product, does advance order has to be given?\": null, \"What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?\": null, \"How much has this solution already been diffused?

(brief problem & solution description)\": \"this idea first occurred to him 11 years ago when he tried to bring electricity to his own house. he worked on the basis that the conventional turbines have just 50% efficiency because of the uselessness of the upper blades, which have no mechanical output as it is a half-immersion version. therefore he tried a full immersion turbine in which the blades were of half the area. but the mechanical output was found to be approximate twice the first version. then he utilized this turbine in his generator cum pump driven by the river kulashi with full submersion. at first, he made the turbine with a bamboo frame and later he strengthened it with an iron one. he also increased the number of blades from eight to twelve. kalita acknowledges that at first, his family was not very interested in the idea, but later on, encouraged him. he is proud to note that his neighbors also benefited from his innovation. he confides that making this turbine successfully has been a satisfying experience. furthermore, the connection with his innovative side has motivated him to pursue further ideas and he mentions that he is considering the development of an energy-related device. remembering with gratitude the assistance offered by mr. diganta kalita - who introduced him to gian- ne - he calls him his best friend in his journey of innovation. kalita has designed two variants of turbine and pump models. initially, he had developed a water turbine using bamboo for harnessing the flow energy from the river to pump water to his land way back in 1998-99. and later with assistance from gian-ne, a voluntary organization working in the field of development of grass-root innovations, he developed another version of the same turbine. first model the first model had a spiral offset arrangement of blades. in this, the blade axis is perpendicular to the flow direction. the offset arrangement of blades provides constant thrust to the system. in conventional water wheels, thrust is available only once when the blade is perpendicular to the flow direction. in the present arrangement, it is similar to the multi-cylinder crank arrangement in which the turbine will get thrust constantly from blades. the offset arrangement also provides sufficient clearance between blades so that floating debris will not clog the blades. since the path of the water takes a spiral shape from the entrance to the exit, the arrangement of blades acts as a screw conveyor. this facilitates the debris to pass on from the entrance to the exit, which facilitates the smooth running of the turbine. the arrangement of the baffle-operated pump, which acts as a submersible pump facilitates the lifting of water. the cost of the complete system is only about rs.3, 000 including labor costs which are quite affordable by small farmers. second model the second one is an improved model in comparison with his first innovation. in this, blades are arranged spirally and the axis of the turbine is parallel to the flow direction. this arrangement is superior in construction and operation. the spiral twist of the blades in addition to tapping energy from the water provides vortex motion to the water at the exit. this feature is found to be novel as the kinetic energy of the water absorbed by the blades is regained by water due to vortex motion. (by creating a vortex in the direction of the flow, resistance will decrease i.e. water velocity will increase). in most of the existing turbines, turbulence created by the wheel rotation affects the velocity considerably. this parameter is of importance when considering the performance of downstream turbines. working principle the turbine is completely submerged below the flow of water (river). the linear kinetic energy of the water is used for giving rotation movement to the turbine. the water passing through the turbine forces the turbine to rotate at low speed but with high torque. when the linear kinetic velocity of the water is two-meter per minute the turbine starts to rotate with a speed of 20 r.p.m. a compound gear mechanism is used to convert the rotational speed of the turbine (20 r.p.m) to a considerable requirement. an armature coil (generator) is used to extract electrical energy. a submersible pump is also coupled to the turbine set for irrigation purposes. the rotational speed of the turbine is given with the help of the driven gear and a flat belt. the turbine is made up of steel foils with a rim where the blades are welded. a-frame is made to hold the turbine in running condition when the turbine is submerged in the water. a compound gear mechanism is used to increase the speed of the armature coil shaft. the generating set (turbine) consists of the following parts namely twelve turbine blades (flat type), a supporting frame/ trust, a drive gear with 10 teeth and a driven gear with 140 teeth, a pulley, a connecting belt (flat type), an armature coil and a chain belt. the blades are welded in a four feet circular rim at an angle of 35\\u00ac\\u221e. the upper parts of the 12 blades are fixed in the circular rim that is four inches in width and the lower part of the turbine is fixed in an axle. a chain is fitted to the turbine axle and the drive gear. a lever mechanism is used to control the generation of the power by disengaging the driven gear where the shaft is coupled. a pump with a guide blade is used for irrigation. the driven gear with the help of a flat belt gives the required rotation of the pump for pumping water. advantages the novelty lies in its portability and the fact that there is no need for a dam. economically it is a better bet as construction and installation cost is minimal at rs.8000, as compared to hydroelectric, steam, or any other power plant where even a micro hydel generator costs at least rs.40,000. the maintenance cost is also quite low compared to the conventional hydroelectric power plant. its efficiency is greater than 50%. it can be set up anywhere be it plains or mountains. and of the greatest importance is the fact that the turbine has a very high potential in rural areas where electric power supply is not available. nif has filed a patent for the zero head water turbine.\", \"Please insert a link to the solution\": null, \"DIY\": 0, \"IP\": 0, \"The solution holder is able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution\": null, \"What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?\": null, \"Prototype\": 0, \"Product\": 0, \"If this solution is a product, is it available in market?\": null, \"If this solution is a product, does advance order has to be given?\": null, \"What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?\": null, \"How much has this solution already been diffused?

    "### Key Elements of the Design\n",
    "For the design I tried to focus in easy to understand plots. \n",
    "Used bar plots to compare the number of solutions with an interactive feature so you could see how the regions solutions decompose by country.  At the start all the regions on the left are in orange and to the rights there is a bar for each country. If you click on the left plot on a region bar the right plot changes to only show the countries in such region. For each bar if you put the cursosr above it gives you the info of what country it is and how many solutions they registered. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see what kind of energies where more used, I added stacked bars to the previousvisualization so the total length of the bar would still be the total number of solutions and the colors represent the fraction of the solutions for a given energy type. In this case the tooltip gives you both the total number of solutions and how many solutions of this specific contry.  At the top of the two stacked bars I added a circle plot showing the total percentage of each solution and the toolbar tells you the kind of energy and percentage of such energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this viz I added a map of the world with the points based on the latitued and longitude the solutions are registered, this in order to get a better approach of the geography of where the solutions are located. \n",
    "\n",
    "I repeated the solution of the stacked bars to the data of the clean cooking solutions to be able to compare it with the general data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For DIY and prototypes I choose a scatter plot as the medium and one point per country with the color representing the region and being able to select by region to see if there is any trend by region. The y axis represent the fraction of DIY/(DIY+Intelectual Property) while the y axis is the ratio of Prototypes/(Prototypes+Product). I choose this design to sse if there was any trend between thoose two aspects of the projects or any regional trend.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally to see which sustainable goals where more approached I did two scatter plots one by region that if you click would see the one by country. I use color to group by region and size of the mark to show how many solutions had the goal. From the plot it was clear number 7 was the most approached so I lloked at a word plot to see what kind of tags where more often added to solutions addresing sustainable goal number 7. \n",

    "### Evaluation Approach\n",
    "For the evaluation approach as there wont be a lot of people evaluating I though the think aloud would be the best approach and to see what they think of the different ways the data is visualized and what insights they get from it. \n",
    "Three persons interacted with the visualizations, and I asked them to say everything they where thinking and discovering while they interacted with the visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were 2 females and a male, two above 70 and the other one in her 40s. \n",
    "For the elder ones tha interaction wasn't intitive at all, they didn't click on the visualizations even when told and had a bit of a hard time with the colors. They still got the main insights of the graohs showing the numbers of solutions by country and region, all noticed that most of the solutions where in Africa and that India was the country with more solutions. They also noticed that there are large regions of the world with out any solutions reported and specifically that the solutions came only from Developing contries.  When showed by type of energy one found the colors confusing as he couldnt tell between orange and pink, and that when all the countries were selected we couldnt tell between the countries. Other one appreciate tha solar was yellow, unknow was grey and hydro blue, but that didnt repeated in the clean cooking ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "They all found the scatter ratios plot confusing and didnt see the point of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the 17 UN Sutainable Goals plot all needed an explanation of what the y axis was as neither of them knew anything about the UN sustainable goals, so if the visualization is for the general public I would need to add a chart showing what this goals are and its number. One suggested that the color didnt help her understand the data and would be better if the color represnts the goal instead of the region of the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the clean cooking the main message for the 3 of them was that there wasn't enough infromation about the energy sources as half of them dont have the energy source stated in the original data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the evaluation gave me a lot of points of how I could improve the visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the selection, the older ones prefered the mouseover to get more info as the clicking wasn't intuitive fro them at all, however for the younger one the mouse over was annoying as when moving the coursor to focus on a detail the plot on the left would change without her wanting to do that. \n"

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "What worked best of the visualizations where the bar plots showing the number of solutions and the focus of the country specially with the toolbar showing the data of each bar or piece of bar. The map gaves more of a geograpicall sense of where there is no data, but because the latitude and longitude data wasn't perfect in the data set it also made it a bit confusing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both scatter plots would need more context and explanation to be usefull for the general public. Probably the visualization should include the UN infographic about their sustainable goals, what each number is.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the clean cooking data had too many unknows as energy sources showing the stacked bars wasnt as effective as the main insigith you get when seeing it is that more than half od the energy sources are unknow so the details of which regions and countries have more clean cooking solutions independently of the energy source got lost. To improve it I would change it to a simple bar plot only showing the number of clean cooking solutions or one showing the toal and with a color showing which of such solutions are clean cooking by country. So instead of having to check betwen the two visualizations, one for Total and one for cleaning, one single would have all the data. "
